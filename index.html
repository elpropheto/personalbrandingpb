            <h3>Fiction Writer<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:3;"></span></h3>
            <p>I started writing at 13 years old. I remember I was devasted that Harry Potter is "only" 7 books. I didn't want to end it there, so I started writing my own sequel - in a math notebook, during a lesson. It was obviously ridiculously bad and very short, as I couldn't force myself to write more than 10-20 pages. 
                <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br>
            </p>
            <p>During middle school I didn't write a lot, but I had tons of new ideas. Evaporated oceans as a huge jail for inmates all around the world, cruel fantasy world with guns, a love story exclusively over the phone - you name it. Everything around me was able to inspire me, but I just couldn't force myself to open Microsoft Word and start writing. Everything changed with my new, still favourite to this day, idea - a cyberpunk-ish world where video games got banned, and so the fans must play in underground organisations. <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>
            <p> Today this book is called "Koniec Gry". I started writing it in 2018 but hated it every time I managed to start. Then COVID-19 happened and I had to stay at home, so I had many more opportunities to just start over and over... until I found one version I liked. I finished it in 2020 and never looked back.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>
            <p>Right now "Koniec Gry" grew to a trilogy and MANY things about it changed, but I still love it the same as I did 6 years ago. I can't wait to share it with the world.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>

        <div class="network-content">
            <p>Building my network as a fiction writer involves a strategic approach to connecting with readers, fellow writers, industry professionals, and influencers..<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>
            <p>To begin with, I will focus on estabilishing online presence - create a Facebook profile and maintain my blog and/or website to post content for my potential readers. Later down the line I'm planning to actively participate in literary events and conferences, both in-person and online, to meet like-minded individuals and expand my professional circle. <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>
            <p> I will also prioritize providing value to my network by sharing valuable content, offering mentorship, and supporting the work of others. Through consistent communication, following up on new connections, and celebrating the successes of my peers, I aim to maintain and grow these relationships, creating a supportive and vibrant network that enhances my journey as a fiction writer.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>
            <p>If I get lucky, I might even connect with a professional, published writer. That way the journey to my goals would be simplified, as writers are a trusted source for publishers. However, this is not my main goal. I want to get to the finish line on my own, not on someone else's back.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span> <br></p>

        <div class="personalbrand-content">
            <p>My personal brand, defined by my unique voice, diverse interests, and commitment to continuous learning, will significantly enhance my presence in the labor market. As a fiction writer, my ability to craft compelling narratives and create emotionally resonant stories showcases my creativity and communication skills—highly valued traits in many professional settings. <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"><br></span></p>
            <p>Additionally, my engagement in various intellectual pursuits, such as programming, astronomy, and technology, demonstrates my versatility and capacity for critical thinking. These attributes, combined with my active presence on social media and participation in professional organizations, position me as a well-rounded candidate who brings a unique perspective to any role.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"><br></span></p>
            <p>By consistently showcasing my strengths and values through my personal brand, I can attract opportunities that align with my skills and aspirations, making me a standout candidate in the competitive labor market.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"><br></span></p>
            <p>For example, my personal brand would help me to achieve certain positions, such as: quest designer, video game script director, copywriter, SEO specialist, tabletop RPG handbook writer and many others.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"><br></span></p>

        <div class="achievementcontrol-content">
            <p>Controlling my goals achievement involves a systematic approach to setting, tracking, and evaluating progress. <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span> <br></p>
                <p>First, I will clearly define my goals, breaking them down into actionable and measurable steps. Utilizing tools such as project management software, calendars, and to-do lists will help me stay organized and ensure that I am consistently working towards these objectives. <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span> <br></p>
                    
                <p>Regular self-assessment and reflection will be crucial, allowing me to review my progress, celebrate milestones, and identify areas for improvement. It will aslo be important to stay flexible: a tight schedule might boost productivity, but I believe it will do more harm than good in the long run, especially with creative tasks. <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span> <br></p>
            <p>Additionally, seeking feedback from mentors, peers, and my network will provide valuable external perspectives and support. By maintaining flexibility and being willing to adjust my strategies as needed, I can effectively navigate challenges and stay on course. This disciplined approach will enable me to control and achieve my goals, ensuring continuous personal and professional growth.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:2;"></span> <br></p>
